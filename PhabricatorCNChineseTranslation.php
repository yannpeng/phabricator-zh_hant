  '**Step 2 of 2 - Configure Phabricator OAuth Instance**

To configure Phabricator OAuth, create a new application here:

%s/oauthserver/client/create/

When creating your application, use these settings:

  - **Redirect URI:** Set this to: `%s`

After completing configuration, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to the fields above. (You may need to generate the client secret by clicking \'New Secret\' first.)' => NULL,
  '**Step 2 of 2**: In this step, you will configure JIRA.

**Create a JIRA Application**: Log into JIRA and go to **Administration**, then **Add-ons**, then **Application Links**. Click the button labeled **Add Application Link**, and use these settings to create an application:

  - **Server URL**: `%s`
  - Then, click **Next**. On the second page:
  - **Application Name**: `Phabricator`
  - **Application Type**: `Generic Application`
  - Then, click **Create**.

**Configure Your Application**: Find the application you just created in the table, and click the **Configure** link under **Actions**. Select **Incoming Authentication** and click the **OAuth** tab (it may be selected by default). Then, use these settings:

  - **Consumer Key**: Set this to the "Consumer Key" value in the form above.
  - **Consumer Name**: `Phabricator`
  - **Public Key**: Set this to the "Public Key" value in the form above.
  - **Consumer Callback URL**: `%s`
Click **Save** in JIRA. Authentication should now be configured, and this provider should work correctly.' => NULL,
  '**Storage Not Initialized**: There is no database storage initialized in this storage namespace ("%s"). Use **%s** to initialize storage.' => NULL,
  '**Why do bot accounts need an email address?**

Although bots do not normally receive email from Phabricator, they can interact with other systems which require an email address. Examples include:

  - If the account takes actions which //send// email, we need     an address to use in the //From// header.
  - If the account creates commits, Git and Mercurial require     an email address for authorship.
  - If you send email //to// Phabricator on behalf of the     account, the address can identify the sender.
  - Some internal authentication functions depend on accounts     having an email address.


The address will automatically be verified, so you do not need to be able to receive mail at this address, and can enter some invalid or nonexistent (but correctly formatted) address like `bot@yourcompany.com` if you prefer.' => '**为何机器人帐号需要电子邮件地址?**

虽然机器人一般不会接受到来自 Phabricator 的邮件，但会与其他需要电子邮件地址的系统互动，例如：

  - 若这个帐号做的动作会 //发送// 邮件，我们会需要使用邮件地址来填写 //寄件者// 标头。
  - 若这个帐号建立了提交，Git 与 Mercurial 会需要邮件地址来记录作者。
  - 若您用代表帐号的邮件地址发送邮件到 //到// Phabricator，系统可以透过邮件地址来辨识寄件者。
  - 部份内部认証功能会使用到帐号的邮件地址。


这个邮件地址会自动被验証通过，所以您无须到此地址接收邮件，若您想要也可以输入无效或不存在的地址如 `bot@yourcompany.com`。',
  '**reparse** __what__ __which_parts__ [--trace] [--force]

Rerun the Diffusion parser on specific commits and repositories. Mostly useful for debugging changes to Diffusion.

e.g. enqueue reparse owners in the TEST repo for all commits:
repository reparse --all TEST --owners

e.g. do same but exclude before yesterday (local time):
repository reparse --all TEST --owners --min-date yesterday
repository reparse --all TEST --owners --min-date "today -1 day".

e.g. do same but exclude before 03/31/2013 (local time):

  'After configuring Phabricator to process inbound mail, you can interact with objects (like tasks and revisions) over email. For information on configuring Phabricator, see **[[ %s | Configuring Inbound Email ]]**.

In most cases, you can reply to email you receive from Phabricator to leave comments. You can also use **mail commands** to take a greater range of actions (like claiming a task or requesting changes to a revision) without needing to log in to the web UI.

Mail commands are keywords which start with an exclamation point, like `!claim`. Some commands may take parameters, like `!assign alincoln`.

To use mail commands, write one command per line at the beginning or end of your mail message. For example, you could write this in a reply to task email to claim the task:

```
!claim

I\'ll take care of this.
```


When Phabricator receives your mail, it will process any commands first, then post the remaining message body as a comment. You can execute multiple commands at once:

```
!assign alincoln
!close

I just talked to @alincoln, and he showed me that he fixed this.

You can read more about this option in the MySQL documentation to help you make a decision about how to configure it for your use case. There are no concerns specific to Phabricator which make it different from normal workloads with respect to this setting.

To adjust the setting, add something like this to your %s file (in the %s section), replacing %s with an appropriate value for your host and use case. Then restart %s:

%s
If you\'re satisfied with the current setting, you can safely ignore this setup warning.' => NULL,
  'Database host "%s" is using the builtin stopword file for building search indexes. This can make Phabricator\'s search feature less useful.

Stopwords are common words which are not indexed and thus can not be searched for. The default stopword file has about 500 words, including various words which you are likely to wish to search for, such as \'various\', \'likely\', \'wish\', and \'zero\'.

To make search more useful, you can use an alternate stopword file with fewer words. Alternatively, if you aren\'t concerned about searching for common words, you can ignore this warning. If you later plan to configure ElasticSearch, you can also ignore this warning: this stopword file only affects MySQL fulltext indexes.

To choose a different stopword file, add this to your %s file (in the %s section) and then restart %s:

  'Normally, Differential revisions remain on the dashboard when they are "Accepted", and the author then commits the changes to "Close" the revision and move it off the dashboard.

If you have an unusual workflow where Differential is used for post-commit review (normally called "Audit", elsewhere in Phabricator), you can set this flag to treat the "Accepted" state as a "Closed" state and end the review workflow early.

Since profiling is slow and generates a lot of data, you should set this to 0 in production (to disable it) or to a large number (to collect a few samples, if you\'re interested in having some data to look at eventually). In development, it may be useful to set it to 1 in order to debug performance problems.

  'Send a message about the status of a build target to Harbormaster, notifying the application of build results in an external system.

Sending Messages
================
If you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.

The simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.

When you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.

If you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn\'t completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn\'t have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.

Message Types
=============
When you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbomaster that a build completed successfully.

Supported message types are:

%s

Unit Results
============
You can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.

To provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result shoud be a dictionary with these keys:

%s

The `result` parameter recognizes these test results:

%s

This is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:



```lang=json
%s```

Lint Results
============
Like unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:

%s

The `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:

%s

This is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:

```lang=json
%s```

  'When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).

For many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:

  - You want users to be able to login with either their username     or their email address.
  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.
  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).
  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.

**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won\'t let you apply complex restrictions to logins.

  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding
  sn

**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.

Searches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.

A common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:

  lang=text,name=Simple Example
  sn

A slightly more complex configuration might let the user login with either their login name or email address:

  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes
  mail
  sn

If your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to login with either their email address or username, but only if they\'re in specific departments:

  lang=text,name=Complex Example
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

All of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.' => NULL,

You can exit this workflow, continue using Phabricator without applying adjustments, update MySQL at a later date, and then run this workflow again. This is also a good approach, and will let you delay downtime until later.
