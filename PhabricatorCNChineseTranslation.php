  'When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).

For many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:

  - You want users to be able to login with either their username     or their email address.
  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.
  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).
  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.

**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won\'t let you apply complex restrictions to logins.

  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding
  sn

**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.

Searches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.

A common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:

  lang=text,name=Simple Example
  sn

A slightly more complex configuration might let the user login with either their login name or email address:

  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes
  mail
  sn

If your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to login with either their email address or username, but only if they\'re in specific departments:

  lang=text,name=Complex Example
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

All of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.' => '当使用者输入其 LDAP 帐号及密码到 Phabricator 时，Phabricator 可直接使用这个凭证连线到 LDAP (较简单但功能较弱) 或使用匿名凭证连线到 LDAP 搜寻与提供资料符合的记录 (较複杂但功能较强)。

对于大多数情况，直接连线便已足够，然而以下这些情况您可能会想要先搜寻资料：

  - 您想要让使用者能够使用其使用者名称或其电子邮件位址登入。
  - 登入/使用者名称并非 LDAP 记录辨识名称 (DN) 的一部份。
  - 您想要限制只有一部份的使用者能够登入 (例如只允许在某个部门中的使用者)。
  - 您的 LDAP 服务器被设定成使用直接连线无法正常运作的模式。

**要直接连线** 可输入与登入名称对应的 LDAP 属性至下方 **搜寻属性** 输入框，通常这个值会是 `sn` 或 `uid`。这是最简单的设定方式，但只有在使用者名称是辨识名称的一部份时才可用，且无法让您在登入使用较複杂的限制规则。

  lang=text,name=简单直接连线
  sn

**要先搜寻** 需于下方提供匿名使用者名称与密码 (或勾选 **永远搜寻** 核选方块) 然后输入一个或多个查询条件到此栏位，一个条件一行。在连线之后会使用这些条件来辨识与使用者输入的登入名称相关的记录。

会依序使用查询条件直到找到符合的记录，每个查询条件可以是一个简单的属性名称 (例如 `sn` 或 `mail`)，这会搜寻与该属性相符的记录，或者是一个複杂的条件，会使用 `${login}` 字串来代表登入名称。

常见简单的设定只需要一个属性名称，如 `sn`，会与直接连线运作的方式相同：

  lang=text,name=简单范例
  sn

再複杂一点的设定可让使用者用其登入名称或电子邮件位址登入：

  lang=text,name=符合多个属性
  mail
  sn

若您的 LDAP 目录结构较複杂，或者您想要执行较複杂的筛选，您可以使用更複杂的查询条件。依您的目录结构而定，这个范例可让指定部门的使用者用其电子邮件位址或使用者名称登入：

  lang=text,name=複杂范例
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

所有上述使用的属性名称只是范例：您的 LDAP 服务器可能使用其他的属性名称。',

You can read more about this option in the MySQL documentation to help you make a decision about how to configure it for your use case. There are no concerns specific to Phabricator which make it different from normal workloads with respect to this setting.

IMPORTANT: Phabricator determines if a request is HTTPS or not by examining the PHP `%s` variable. If you run Apache/mod_php this will probably be set correctly for you automatically, but if you run Phabricator as CGI/FCGI (e.g., through nginx or lighttpd), you need to configure your web server so that it passes the value correctly based on the connection type.

For example, if you are migrating to new hardware, you could perform a test migration first, make sure things work, and then do a production cutover later with higher confidence and less disruption.

However, if a request takes a very long time to return, some components (like Apache, nginx, or PHP itself) may abort the request before it finishes. This can prevent you from using profiling tools to understand page performance in detail.

In these cases, you can use this option to force the page to abort after a smaller number of seconds (for example, 10), and dump a useful stack trace. This can provide useful information about why a page is hanging.

To use this option, set it to a small number (like 10), and reload a hanging page. The page should exit after 10 seconds and give you a stack trace.

Sending Messages
================
If you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.

The simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.

When you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.

If you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn\'t completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn\'t have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.

Message Types
=============
When you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbomaster that a build completed successfully.

Supported message types are:

%s

Unit Results
============
You can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.

To provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result shoud be a dictionary with these keys:

%s

The `result` parameter recognizes these test results:

%s

This is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:



```lang=json
%s```

Lint Results
============
Like unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:

%s

The `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:

%s

This is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:

```lang=json
%s```

You can exit this workflow, continue using Phabricator without applying adjustments, update MySQL at a later date, and then run this workflow again. This is also a good approach, and will let you delay downtime until later.

You can proceed with this workflow, and then optionally update MySQL at a later date. After you do, you\'ll need to apply adjustments again.

  'After configuring Phabricator to process inbound mail, you can interact with objects (like tasks and revisions) over email. For information on configuring Phabricator, see **[[ %s | Configuring Inbound Email ]]**.

In most cases, you can reply to email you receive from Phabricator to leave comments. You can also use **mail commands** to take a greater range of actions (like claiming a task or requesting changes to a revision) without needing to log in to the web UI.

Mail commands are keywords which start with an exclamation point, like `!claim`. Some commands may take parameters, like `!assign alincoln`.

To use mail commands, write one command per line at the beginning or end of your mail message. For example, you could write this in a reply to task email to claim the task:

```
!claim

I\'ll take care of this.
```


When Phabricator receives your mail, it will process any commands first, then post the remaining message body as a comment. You can execute multiple commands at once:

```
!assign alincoln
!close

I just talked to @alincoln, and he showed me that he fixed this.

  '**Why do bot accounts need an email address?**

Although bots do not normally receive email from Phabricator, they can interact with other systems which require an email address. Examples include:

  - If the account takes actions which //send// email, we need     an address to use in the //From// header.
  - If the account creates commits, Git and Mercurial require     an email address for authorship.
  - If you send email //to// Phabricator on behalf of the     account, the address can identify the sender.
  - Some internal authentication functions depend on accounts     having an email address.


The address will automatically be verified, so you do not need to be able to receive mail at this address, and can enter some invalid or nonexistent (but correctly formatted) address like `bot@yourcompany.com` if you prefer.' => '**为何机器人帐号需要电子邮件位址?**

虽然机器人一般不会接受到来自 Phabricator 的邮件，但会与其他需要电子邮件位址的系统互动，例如：

  - 若这个帐号做的动作会 //发送// 邮件，我们会需要使用邮件位址来填写 //寄件者// 标头。
  - 若这个帐号建立了提交，Git 与 Mercurial 会需要邮件位址来记录作者。
  - 若您用代表帐号的邮件位址发送邮件到 //到// Phabricator，系统可以透过邮件位址来辨识寄件者。
  - 部份内部认証功能会使用到帐号的邮件位址。


这个邮件位址会自动被验証通过，所以您无须到此位址接收邮件，若您想要也可以输入无效或不存在的位址如 `bot@yourcompany.com`。',
